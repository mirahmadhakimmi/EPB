        <h1>What is the Emotion?</h1>
        <p class="psychological">Emotions are psychological states brought on by neurophysiological changes, variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure.
            There is currently no scientific consensus on a definition. Emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity, and motivation
            Research on emotion has increased over the past two decades with many fields contributing including psychology, medicine, history, sociology of emotions, and computer science.
            The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, function and other aspects of emotions have fostered more intense research on this topic.
            Current areas of research in the concept of emotion include the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion. In addition,
            PET scans and fMRI scans help study the affective picture processes in the brain.
        </p>

        <h1>theories of Emotions in the world?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
              Emotions describe physiological states and are generated subconsciously. Usually, they are autonomous bodily 
              responses to certain external or internal events. By contrast, feelings are subjective experiences of emotions
              and are driven by conscious thoughts and reflections. This means that we can have emotions without having feelings,
              however, we simply cannot have feelings without having emotions.
            </li>
            <li>
               Feelings are effects of frequency emissions...
               .whether from yourself or from others.
              ..ITS METABOLIC also
            </li>
            <li>Animals (Mammals)...We have more in common with animals than many people realize.

                "We are brothers and sisters under the skin and once we and we better recognize that.
                And once we understand them, we will finally understand ourselves."
            </li>
            <li>
                Feelings are response to stimulia,
                 emotions is are interpretations of feelings through are own minds....
            </li>
            <li>
             accepts it totally Everyone is different and unique in there own way...
             For some people its emotions for some its money for some it might be any other luxuries or anything 
              ... Its all about the taste or a personal likes of a person which makes them inti something..
             . So a person can't say without feelings or anything life is incomplete and all... For me its not 
             true if u chase your tastes or do what gives you pleasure then its not at all a worthless life..
              .Its all about the value which we give... In my case iam not a emotional creature and I don't give much importance to it.
             .. For Me life comes ones and I want to make the best out of it... Not to get into some naggy unwanted feelings..
             . So its your life do what makes you happy if its love or emotions or luxuries or passion whatever it may,go for it..
             . Enjoy your life to the best by tasting all the earthly pleasures
            </li>
            <li>
                One of the many quotes from my late dad when there was stress or disagreements......
                "Emotions are often the enemy of the Facts.
            </li>
            <li>
                to understand the power each human being have to control their emotions and that we should invesment 
                more in creating experiences of "pleasure" rather than "loss"
            </li>
            <li>
                Psychologically healthy people, it would seem, are those who have first become "psychologically healthy animals";
                 being able to relate to their own feelings, integrating the "primitive" parts of their brains with their cognition,
                  they doubtlessly have much more capacity for manifesting kindness.
            </li>
            <li>
                i dont agree with his classification of emotions
            </li>
            <li>
                Using drugs to fix symptoms, instead of implementing positive sustainable changes in behaviours, 
                environment and lifestyle that are the actual cause of depression. How much easier is it to take a pill 
                than sort your life out
            </li>
            <li>
             Hard to imagine animals being led to the slaughter house  and smelling and hearing death before they enter the  Killing chambers.
             Why do people not understand that they have emotions just like us and being bred to be killed should be done sensitively
             as it is going to be along time before we stop eating meat.
            </li>
            <li>
             Knowing that emotions of many types is just a chemical release of the brain just tell me it's an addiction to whatever
             chemical is being released therefore all in the head. It's all in the head. It's created like fairy tales. It's not
             real because it's created. Brain works all sorts of wonders.
            </li>
            <li>
              We are advancing our knowledge to understand the three basic questions "Who are we? Why are we here? What is our purpose?"
              Consciousness making a choice to experience emotion, which is the ability to form energy into matter set into motion through 
              a field of a carbon based platform, can and is controlled by thought. The tools are in front of each of us to become more than
              the subconscious allows. CHOOSE the environmental influences which direct (limit) your ability and own your emotional response. You are the creator.
            </li>
            <li>
             The feeling you are talking about is a thought.
             The only feeling I know about is the sensory perception touch.
             Which does not tell you anything, you translate that sensation in the framework of your experiencing structure.
             The animal doesn't have the knowledge to translate the sensation into a feeling.
             An animal's feeling is only interested in the point of contact for purposes of preservation and survival. the sense
             of touch is not there in nature to tell the animal the way it is feeling, it has no functional 
             value in nature so it is discarded. If the animal touches something hot it pulls away, there is no translation necessary,
             it is just responding to the stimulus. This is the way it is functioning. As a person you record this Sensation then you translate it as a feeling.
              there may be thinking in an animal but we have made it such a complicated thing.
             the domestic animals seem to be exhibiting traits more prevalent with human behaviour. But it is not translating the world dialectically. 
             it doesn't know it itself exist, because to know anything about your existence you must have some knowledge of it.
             your identity is only what you know about yourself .animals don't have an identity, they have no language to identify their self. 
              It's just functioning like the heart it does not know it is beating, it is not asking am I doing it right, what is the meaning of life.
             it exists but it doesn't have any knowledge of that fact.
